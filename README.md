# Build-tree-array-from-flat-array-in-javascript
I created this function to convert data from array of objects to tree structure,which is required for d3 tree interactive charts.
With Only 40 lines of code I was able to get the output.
I wrote this function in an efficent way usign recursive funtionality in js.

Try and let me know your feedback.
